FoodApp

important note:
if at some point the app isnt loading, like the menu for each restaurant, check something

1. go through getFood.java, getInfo.java, login.java and signup.java and make sure that the ip is set to the ip beginning with 23.
2. if it still isnt working, that means my dum bum forgot to leave the server on, i will add a feature in the next commit that lets you not need the database to be online
